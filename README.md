<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is my fourth Microverse project, and first solo project.

### Objective
 1. Getting familiar with ways of positioning elements with CSS using flexbox or float.
 2. Understand the way background properties work.
 
### Assignment:
 

   1. Go to this old version of [!apple.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) and have a look around.
   2. Create a blank HTML document.
   3. Plan out how the elements on the page need to be grouped together.
   4. Lay out the empty semantic HTML elements for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer…) and make them  	 the proper size and alignment. It may be helpful to change their background colors while you’re      	 positioning them on the page. Don’t forget to use your browser’s developer tools (right click on the 	 page, click “inspect element”)!
   5. Set up the top navigation bar. How is that gradient achieved?
   6. Set up the main background image. You can grab that exact image from their webpage by finding the <section class="hero"> tag in your inspector and checking out its background image.
   7. Fill in and position the additional sections. Don’t worry about enclosing every paragraph of text in p tags.
   8. Push your solution to Github.
